\chapter{Credit Mining System Design}
\label{chp:design}

% section overview, main components. Libtorrent as dependency. 
The goal of this thesis is to implement a system where it can be used to both gain credit and improve swarm performance. In this thesis, we introduce ``Credit mining system'', an automatic investment framework on swarm with multidimensional properties. With credit mining system, locally, a user can gain credit with limited bandwidth allocation without any intervention needed. We assume the \textit{credit} is the amount of bytes from the system to the community and vice versa. From the higher perspective, credit mining system will help a swarm to keep alive by providing integral pieces to the peer who might need it. 

Firstly, the dependencies of credit mining system which is \textit{libtorrent}'s s\textit{hare mode} will be elaborated. \texttt{Share mode} is a module which can be activated as an intent to helping a swarm instead of normal content downloading. This module will be explained in detail in section \ref{section:sharemode}. Afterward, the design of credit mining system is presented. This system consists of several subroutines which will be explained in section \ref{section:cmcomponents}. 

\section{Libtorrent's share mode}
\label{section:libtorrent}
\label{section:sharemode}
\bt~is just a collection of specifications. It is free to be implemented with any languages. One of most popular implementation is \textit{libtorrent}. \textit{Libtorrent} is written in \texttt{C++} and  has \texttt{python} binding. \textit{Libtorrent} started in 2003 by Arvid Norberg, and it implemented most of the \bt~specification. Most of the well-known extension such as DHT, PEX, magnet link, multi-tracker, and webseed also have been implemented. \textit{Libtorrent} is widely used by many torrent clients such as Deluge, qBittorrent, Free download managers, and many others.

One of the crucial feature used in this work is \textit{share mode}\footnote{Core code of share mode can be found in \url{https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/blob/master/src/torrent.cpp\#L9586-L9727}}. Initial work performed by \citeauthor{2015:creditmining:capota} also used this feature \cite{2015:creditmining:capota}. By enabling share mode, it means that one is not interested in downloading the file in a swarm, but in gaining higher share ratio instead. It is done by downloading as little as possible and uploading as much as possible. A swarm downloaded in share mode may never finish as \textit{libtorrent} only download the pieces of a torrent which are satisfied the share mode requirements.

Share mode algorithm works heuristically as it estimates the rarest piece available in the swarm based on the participated peers. The algorithm is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:ltsharemode}. For clarity, we divide this algorithm in two part. First part is to pass all the restrictions. It tries to find missing pieces for each peer (line \ref{alg:l_lts:missingp}), disconnects some of the seeders because of connection limit (line \ref{alg:l_lts:disconnectpeers}), and reduces the number of missing pieces with twice the number of seeder (line \ref{alg:l_lts:reducemissing}). For the last, it is based on the assumption that seeder can upload as fast as the system. Share mode will fail if all missing pieces are expected to be provided by the seeders (line \ref{alg:l_lts:retmis}), upload ratio could not be reached (line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdlenough}), or too many parallel download (line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdling}).

The second part of share mode is to determine the rarest piece. \textit{Libtorrent} counts the number of peer for each piece to find the lowest one. The number of peer on the rarest piece is termed \textit{rarity}. Share mode ensures that it only downloads the rarest piece available (line \ref{alg:l_lts:rarepc}). The routine end prematurely if there are not enough peer to upload the rarest piece (line \ref{alg:l_lts:rareunable}). Otherwise, it will randomly download the rarest pieces if there are more than one option (line \ref{alg:l_lts:dlrare}). 

\begin{algorithm}[h!]
	\caption{Libtorrent share mode algorithm}
	\label{alg:ltsharemode}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]

		\EndIf	
		\EndFor
		\If{$|connected\_seeders|$ in $connected\_peer$ $>$ $90\%$}	
		\State disconnect excess seeder \label{alg:l_lts:disconnectpeers}

		\State{$missing\_pieces$} -= {$2 \times |connected\_seeders|$}	\label{alg:l_lts:reducemissing}	
		\If{$missing\_pieces \leq 0$}  \label{alg:l_lts:retmis}
		\State \Return 
		\EndIf
		\If{$num\_downloaded \times T > uploaded$} \label{alg:l_lts:retdlenough}
		\State \Return
		\EndIf
		\If{$downloading > 5\% \times num\_downloaded$} \label{alg:l_lts:retdling}
		\State \Return
		\EndIf
		\Statex \hrulefill \Comment{Part 2}
		\State{$rarest\_rarity \gets MAX\_INTEGER$} 
		\ForAll{$pc \in pieces()$}
		\If{$pc$ not in $collected\_piece$ $and$ $peer\_count(pc) \leq rarest\_rarity$ }	\label{alg:l_lts:rarepc}
		\State{$rarest\_rarity \gets peer\_count(pc)$} 
		\State{$rare\_piece$.push($pc$)}
		\EndIf	
		\EndFor
		\If{$|connected\_peers| - rarest\_rarity < T$} \label{alg:l_lts:rareunable}
		\State \Return
		\EndIf
		\State download {$random(rare\_piece)$} \label{alg:l_lts:dlrare}
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

There are two limitations on this feature as we observed. Firstly, share mode did not check whether a swarm is good enough to perform this operation. It only tries to find popular pieces regardless of the swarm condition. Consequently, it has a possibility that the operations will not go well. For example, it is difficult to gain credit in a saturated swarm as there is not enough demand. Therefore, the user is fully responsible whether share mode will yield high credit, or it will waste his resource.

Secondly, the biggest limitation of share mode is the possibilities of getting bottleneck because of its strict policy. In the early stage of joining a swarm, share mode downloaded very few pieces at a time. For example, until the system has downloaded at least 20 pieces, it will only download one piece (5\%) at a time in share mode (line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdling}). It is also necessary to wait for that single piece to be uploaded (line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdlenough}) to at least $T$ peers. The combination of line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdlenough} and \ref{alg:l_lts:retdling} can result in slower decision making, and then the rarity of pieces may have changed. If the system is too late to completely receive the piece, or the piece is not uploaded fast enough, this piece could be obsolete as nobody wants it anymore. Therefore, the condition in line \ref{alg:l_lts:retdlenough} may never be satisfied. If other pieces could not cover this condition (by uploading to more than $T$ peers), then share mode unable to continue. The system then will not download nor upload any pieces anymore.

\section{Credit Mining Architecture}
\label{section:cmcomponents}

Credit mining system is intended to do the assigned task automatically with minimal user intervention. The way this system designed is to align supply and demand of chosen swarm. Short term advantage of this approach is to gain credit by minimizing download and maximizing upload. In the long term, this potentially increases overall performance of other users as well.

The system can be implemented on any torrent client. In Figure \ref{fig:cmcomponents}, it shows the compulsory elements and the relation between the \textit{credit mining system} and the \textit{torrent client}. Currently, we assume that every torrent client also tracks how much data a user has been downloaded and uploaded in \textit{credit storage}. Naturally, any torrent client must have so-called \textit{client downloader} module as well. \textit{Libtorrent} library also must exist as part of the dependencies. Another required feature is the ability to discover peer by all method (DHT, PEX, LSD, and so on). In some cases, peer discovery function is disabled for security reasons. While disabling one should not affect credit mining system, it will reduce overall prospecting accuracy.

Credit mining system consists of several elements. Those are \textit{credit mining manager}, \textit{miners}, \textit{mining sources}, \textit{settings} object, and \textit{prospecting engine}. The \textit{manager} receives the \textit{settings} from user in the initial phase. To control mining process, the user can only interact with the elements specified in \textit{settings}. User action is also limited to only add and remove \textit{mining source}. Each of the sources will be assigned with a \textit{miner} that depends on the type of the source. \textit{Miner} also has sub-elements as part of the system. In-depth explanation of mining source and \textit{miners} will be discussed in Section \ref{section:msource}. In \textit{prospecting engine}, prospecting mechanism is taking place. Prospecting mechanism as part of the investment methodology will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:prospection}.

% general flow
Before credit mining system is executed, a user can change the settings used in the credit mining system. For example, if a user has a lot of memory available, it is desirable to mine many swarms in one time by changing \textit{max\_torrents\_active} parameter. Another example is if a user has large storage, decreasing \textit{share\_mode\_target} may yield in a better return. Some settings can not be changed when mining process already run. Table \ref{tbl:cmsettings} shows the settings used in this system. 

After user provides the setting and runs the \textit{credit manager}, the user can start mining by adding sources. A source usually consists of several swarms with different size, availability, and capacity. Each of the sources will be assigned with one \textit{miner}. Before the miners start mining, \textit{prospecting engine} fetches swarm information and then give the results to the manager .The manager will propagate the swarm information to miners and let the miners decide which swarm to mine based on that information. The manager also monitors the main torrent downloader to adjust miners bandwidth allocation. The credit gained from each of the miners will be reported to the manager, and then it forwards the results to credit storage in torrent client if necessary.

%The rest of this section will discuss key points of credit mining system. Several mining source types are supported with different treatment from miners. Prospecting methodology on top of libtorrent share mode will be elaborated afterwards. The methodology consists of two integral stages. Each of the stage has their own mechanism and requirements. Lastly, we will discuss other components that can support credit mining system of its prospecting, performance, and credit gain. 

\subsection{Mining Sources}
\label{section:msource} 
Currently, credit mining system can accommodate three types of sources. There are directory source, RSS source, and channel source. The miner will be initiated the moment the source is defined and added to the manager. A miner periodically monitors all the swarms in the source.

The first type of source is called \textit{directory source}. The system takes and verifies local directory path containing \texttt{.torrent} file. Each of the files is examined and validated. Any corrupt or invalid file will be discarded and deleted automatically from the disk. The miner then sorts the files alphabetically and puts it into the queue. Both the directory and the queue are periodically monitored by the miner in case of the incoming new swarms. Miner eventually will pop an item from the queue one by one, build a suitable format for mining, and notify the manager to include this swarm.

Next possible mining source is from RSS (Rich Site Summary). RSS is a well-known method to fetch newly published data from the web. An RSS document contains the list of affected content which usually has summarized text and metadata. An RSS from a torrent portal such as etree\footnote{\url{http://bt.etree.org/rss/bt_etree_org.rdf}} and mininova\footnote{\url{http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml}} usually have the title, publication date and a link to the swarm. RSS also can easily be generated from private trackers for various purposes. We called a source of RSS document as \textit{RSS feed}. 

In \textit{RSS source}, we assume that the RSS link user provided is both available and valid. If by any case the retrieval of the content is failed, the miner will stop immediately, notify the manager to disable this source, and shut down itself. If the initial content retrieval is successful, update mechanism will be launched periodically to fetch the newest content from the RSS feed. This content then parsed, resulting in a list of swarm links and its information. Miner then asynchronously download swarm metadata either via \texttt{.torrent} or magnet link. The same metadata will not be downloaded twice. After fetching the data, miner will build a defined format for mining, and then notify the manager to include this swarm. 

\textit{Channel source} is the last type of source which tightly related to Tribler environment. As mentioned in section \ref{section:tribler} (Table \ref{tbl:community}), a channel is responsible for managing torrents and playlists in Tribler community. A single channel can be discovered in \textit{AllChannel} community. Channel is identified by a unique 40-length hexadecimal string. Tribler user can create their own channel, put torrents into the channel, and share the channel to other users. When a user subscribes to a channel, they will be notified if a new torrent is added into that channel. Moreover, all torrents in subscribed channel will be automatically downloaded into Tribler's database.

Provided the identifier of a channel, the miner will continuously try to find and join the channel in \textit{AllChannel}. By joining the channel, the miner can get a list of torrents and its properties. After miner joined the channel, the swarm metadata will be downloaded by a mechanism in Tribler. Miner then monitors the local database whether a new data has been fetched and whether there is a space for adding new torrent to the manager. After knowing swarm information, the mining format will be built, and the manager will be notified of a ready swarm.

\subsection{User activity awareness}
\label{section:uactivityimpl}
Credit mining is an automatic system to download/upload a swarm. If at the same time, a user is downloading a swarm outside the one in credit mining system, the bandwidth will be split. The user may experience slower download speed and see this as a problem. We define the \textit{user download activity} as the activity that intentionally initiated by the user in order to participate or download content on the particular swarm. Usually, this is the true purpose of having torrent client. 

In response to that issue, we implemented another module in credit mining system to adjust its mining activity to user download activity. Credit mining system periodically observes whether there is a user downloading activity. If there is not any, then it can notify the miners to use all the bandwidth available. In the other case, the system will limit the download and upload rate of mining activity to remaining bandwidth available. At the period of observation, the mining download and upload rate will be set to zero.


\subsection{Resource Optimization}
\label{section:optimization}
In this section, we focus on several optimizations that can be implemented in credit mining system. These optimizations are optional and can be left out. However, as the system itself is not perfect, an improvement to support this system is advantageous. There are two optimizations in credit mining system: duplicate elimination and swarm blacklisting.%, and reusing cache. 

In preliminary work by \citeauthor{2015:creditmining:capota}, credit mining system able to distinguish duplicate content in the P2P communities. It is highly possible that the same file has different \textit{infohash} as its identifier. Infohash of a swarm is an SHA1 hash consists of 40-length hexadecimal characters. An \textit{infohash} of a torrent can come from many aspects such as different piece size, categorized as private or public swarm, or even directory name of the files \cite{2015:creditmining:capota}. We used \textit{Levenshtein distance} to measure the different between one swarm and another by considering the files in it. Specifically, its names and length. In the end, we only mine the one who has higher number of seeder. Eliminating duplicate swarm can lead the peer interaction to be concentrated in one of the swarms. Thus, the performance of participating peer might be improved.

Despite all the features in credit mining system, there is no guarantee that it can constantly gain credit from a particular swarm. The bottleneck in share mode is one of the examples. We introduce \textit{swarm blacklisting} to remove and block low-performance swarm. Miner periodically watches whether data are constantly being downloaded or uploaded from a particular swarm. If no activity can be detected from that swarm for a long period of time, the miner will remove this swarm from its library and block it. That means this swarm can not be chosen by any of the swarm selection policy. It will be added to the library again after several rounds. If by any case, the library is empty and there are swarms blacklisted, those will be added to the library again.

%In the prior work, it is important to note that after mining for a certain swarm was stopped, miners will delete downloaded files to save the storage. Although it is safe for the system to discard downloaded files, the resource used to redownload piece will be costly. This issue is fixed in current credit mining system. Files from a swarm that has been stopped for mining is archived with its history and stored in \textit{cache}. The history consists of the index of the piece that have been downloaded, peer information, statistics, and many others. When mining restarts, if there are new peers requesting piece the system already have, it can be immediately uploaded without need to redownload or check the piece.
