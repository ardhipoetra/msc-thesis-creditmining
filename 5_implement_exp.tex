\section{Tribler integration}
Tribler is well known for its anonymity and secure interface on top of \bt~ network. In 2014, Tribler published a specification on its anonymity feature\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications}}. It uses Tor-like onion routing with purely distributed mechanism. A year later, \citeauthor{2015:tunnel:ruigrok} on his work completed the \textit{tunnel community} which emphasize end-to-end encryption in Tribler. This comes with several drawbacks. The most important one is performance degradation. Adding layers of privacy comes with increasing the amount of cryptography operation which slows down end-to-end downloading activity \cite{2015:tunnel:ruigrok}.

\subsection{Experience enhancement}
\begin{itemize}
	\item  aware user download, priority mehcnism
	\item  enable/disable relaxation
	\item single click choose channel
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anonymous and secure mining}
\begin{itemize}
	\item  usage of tunnel community
	\item  multichain?
\end{itemize}
