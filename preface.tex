I praise to The Almighty God for all of His countless blessing and protection.\\

This thesis is the finish line of my work as an MSc student in Delft University of Technology. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Johan Pouwelse for pushing me and providing feedback on my work. Your excitement and enthusiasm is truly contagious. Secondly, I would like to gratefully acknowledge Endowment Fund for Education / Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan (LPDP) for giving me an opportunity to purse my master's degree. I will do my best to give back everything to my lovely country. Next, I would like to thank everyone in the 7th floor, Elric, Martijn, and Ma for supporting my work. You guys made my time in doing this work more enjoyable. 

Special thanks go to my beloved wife, Hilda Zaikarina. Your wonderful support and patience lead me to the point where I need to \textit{istiqomah} for all the work I have done. 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and motivation throughout not only my thesis, but also my study in The Netherlands.
